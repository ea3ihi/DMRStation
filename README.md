A free and open source DMR network radio by EA3IHI. You can find mode in http://dmrstation.ea3ihi.es

## Notes

The project is configured for cross compiling using eclipse and SysGCC with the STM32MP1 development toolchain.

## Binaries

If you are just looking for binaries, get them from the DMRStation-binaries repository.


## Credits

This software would not exist without the code and inspiration from other projects as Opengd77, HBLink and MMDVM.


## Configuration

Edit `DMRStation.ini` to add your callsign, dmr id, repeater id and other values.

## TGs
You can also set your favourite tgs in the file `tgs.dat`.
A name starting with * means that it is not a TG but a private contact, so you can make private calls!

## DMR ids database

Run `DMRIDSUpdate.sh` to download and update the list of DMR Ids.
